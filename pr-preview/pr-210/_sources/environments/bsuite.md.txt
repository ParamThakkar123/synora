# DeepMind BSuite

The BSuite backend adapts DeepMind's Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning (BSuite) diagnostic tasks to Synora's image-first interface. BSuite tasks provide compact ``dm_env`` observations and mostly discrete actions with known optimal reward profiles, making them useful for detecting fundamental issues in world-model training (e.g. credit assignment, memory, exploration).

Install: ``pip install bsuite``

## Main API

```python
from synora import make_bsuite_env, list_available_bsuite_ids

env = make_bsuite_env("catch/0", seed=42, size=(64, 64))
obs = env.reset()
print(obs["image"].shape)  # (3, 64, 64)

# List all installed BSuite task IDs
print(list_available_bsuite_ids()[:5])
```

When BSuite is not installed, ``list_available_bsuite_ids()`` returns example IDs: ``bandit/0``, ``cartpole/0``, ``catch/0``, ``deep_sea/0``, ``discounting_chain/0``, ``memory_len/0``, ``mnist/0``, ``mountain_car/0``, ``umbrella_chain/0``.

## Seed determinism

``BSuiteImageEnv`` accepts a ``seed`` parameter at construction. The seed controls the internal RNG for action-space sampling in ``_BSuiteDiscreteActionSpace``. BSuite itself does not expose a native ``seed`` API (its randomness is encoded in the ``bsuite_id``), so ``reset(seed=...)`` reseeds only the wrapper's action-space RNG:

```python
env = make_bsuite_env("catch/0", seed=10)
action_a = env.action_space.sample()  # deterministic for seed=10

env.reset(seed=20)
action_b = env.action_space.sample()  # deterministic for seed=20
```

## Observations

``BSuiteImageEnv`` converts BSuite's compact ``dm_env`` observations into synthetic RGB images:

- Native BSuite observations are flattened and normalised to ``[0, 1]``.
- The flattened array is arranged onto a square canvas and repeated to 3 channels.
- The canvas is resized to ``(H, W)`` using bilinear interpolation.
- The result is returned as ``{"image": uint8 array with shape (3, H, W)}``.

When ``include_state=True``, observations also include a ``"state"`` key with the flattened raw observation vector.

```python
env = make_bsuite_env("catch/0", include_state=True)
obs = env.reset()
assert "image" in obs and "state" in obs
```

## Actions

BSuite tasks expose discrete actions. ``BSuiteImageEnv`` maps them to a continuous one-hot ``Box`` of shape ``(n,)`` with values in ``[-1, 1]``. The selected action is the index of the largest value. ``info["action"]`` stores the one-hot vector; ``info["executed_action"]`` stores the integer index.

## Info contract

| Key | Always? | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| ``discount`` | Yes | ``float32`` scalar from the BSuite ``TimeStep`` |
| ``bsuite_id`` | Yes | Task identifier string (e.g. ``"catch/0"``) |
| ``action`` | Yes | One-hot action vector |
| ``executed_action`` | Yes | Integer index sent to the BSuite environment |
| ``vector_observation`` | Yes | Flattened raw observation array |
| ``terminated`` | Yes | ``bool`` — True when BSuite ``TimeStep.last()`` |
| ``truncated`` | Yes | Always ``False`` (BSuite does not expose time limits) |

## Troubleshooting

- **``ImportError: No module named bsuite``**: install the optional dependency with ``pip install bsuite``.
- **``"catch/0" not recognised``**: verify the task ID exists in your BSuite installation with ``list_available_bsuite_ids()``.
- **Synthetic images are uninformative**: BSuite observations are small numeric vectors tiled onto a canvas; the synthetic image preserves all information but may look unfamiliar. Use ``include_state=True`` to access the raw vector alongside the image.
